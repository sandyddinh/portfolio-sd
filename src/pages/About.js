              During my time in management consulting, I served a wide range of roles including Project Management and Business Analysis before finding my way to Digital Engineering projects as a QA Engineer. I helped a large Brazilian bank launch their millenial digital-only banking app.

              When the pandemic hit, I comitted to developing my software engineering skillsets by completing an immersive bootcamp at General Assembly while still working a full time job. This experience re-affirmed my passion of coding. I hope you check out my portfolio.

              My other passion is yoga. I have been practicing for over 5 years and obtained my Yoga Teacher Training 200hr cerfication in 2018. My practice has influenced my mindful approach to coding.
